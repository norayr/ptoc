This is Pascal To C transpiler.

It was probably last touched in 1987 before me, at least there's that date in the makefile.

Unfortunately the license requires to distribute the source unaltered.

As required, I am distributing source unaltered.

Also I provide a statically linked x86 gnu linux binary which I built back in 2005 with gpc.
The only change was replacing "message" with "writeln" in order to compile.
